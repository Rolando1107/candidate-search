## Description
The Candidate Search App is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding potential candidates for job positions using the GitHub API. This app allows users to search for GitHub users based on specific criteria, review their profiles, and make decisions to either accept or reject them as potential candidates. Accepted candidates are then added to a table for further review and comparison.

If you choose to accept a user, you can visit the "Saved Candidates" section on the navbar to view more details and compare the candidates collectively.
